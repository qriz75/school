    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Mau-Mau</h1>
<h3>History: It originated in Germany in the 1930s and has no official governing body. The rules vary immensely by region and the game was further developed into games like Uno, Mio, Solo and more. Today Mau-Mau is popular in all German-speaking countries as well as France, Spain, Greek, and even Brasil.</h3>
<h3>This game is modeled after the variant played in a neighborhood of the Reinickendorf borough of Berlin, Germany.</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Rules are fairly simple and this game can be played by young kids as well as adults.</p>
<p>The game is best played by 2 to 6 players with a 32 or 52 card deck. The goal is to get rid of your cards first.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start: The person who suggested to play is the dealer. The first step is to shuffle the deck and depending on the deck every player receives 5 cards (when played with 32 cards)&nbsp; or 7 cards (when played with 52 cards) These cards are called the hand.</p>
<p>The remaining cards are placed face down as the pickup pile. The dealer takes the top card and turns it around, and hereby starting the discard pile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The player next in clockwise direction has the chance to put a card from his hand down with either the same suit (Diamonds, Heart, Spades, or Clubs) or with the same value.</p>
<p>If the player can do so the turn goes to the next player. If he can't match suit or value with any of his cards, the player has to draw a card and try again. If still no match is available to turn goes to the next player and so on.</p>
<p>The game has special cards with the following attributes&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<td style="width: 25%;">(This step can be repeated with multiple aces.)&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

</table>
<p>When a player lays down the 2nd to the last card he or she has to call out "Mau"</p>
<p>if the turn passes on and the next player lays down a card any player can point out the "Mau" wasn't called and the player in question has to draw a card.</p>
<p>When the final card is placed "Mau-Mau" is called and the game is won.</p>
<p>The remaining player will continue until only one person is left, who will be the dealer in the next round.</p>
